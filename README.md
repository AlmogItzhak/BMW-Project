**Supervised Machine Learning on highly imbalanced datasets**

Imbalanced datasets for supervised machine learning are important to handle because they can lead to poor model performance and inaccurate predictions in the minority class.
By using techniques to balance the data set for example, it is possible to train a more accurate model, which will be able to better predict the minority class.

In this project done in collaboration with the BMW company, I worked with imbalanced data, also for some car data, some of the data sets are very unbalanced,
for example, 99% belong to some class and only 1% remaining to the other class

The challenge is when using Machine learning algorithms since an algorithm that classifies each part as the first class (to which most of the datasets belong) will have high accuracy, but will not really produce good results.

In this project I made a literature survey and a pipeline which I applied methods and algorithms in it to balance data sets for example. 
I created a generic pipeline that allows handling and balancing imbalanced data sets and finally checking and choosing which method is most suitable for balancing the given data set with the help of the evaluation metrics.
